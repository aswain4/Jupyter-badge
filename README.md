# Jupyter-badge
This is to fulfill requirements for the Jupyter badge for the UVA MSDS online program.
1. Complete problems 1-3 on Project Euler.
   * The files with labels such as jupyterprob1 are the jupyterlab files uploaded to GitHub
   * Files with labels such as prob1_solution are the same code in done in GitHub

2. The file titled dist_w_random contains the code and histograms of 3 common probability distributions.
   * numpy was used to generate the random numbers
   * matplotlib used to create the histograms

3. bi-norm_distribution is a JupyterLab markdown file (with some code) as a visual representation of the central limit theorem.

4. classdata is a Jupyter file involving code and markdowns.
   * This is the presentation that goes through each category of the class hardware survey from 2023-06-13
   * It starts with the categorical data, then each numerical category, and ends with the data I could not visualize
   * I ran into a frequent problem where the labels would appear in the wrong order, but the data with that label was correct
       - Example is graph should have decreasing slope and labeled [0, 1, 2], but instead has normal distribution shape and labeled [1, 0, 2]
